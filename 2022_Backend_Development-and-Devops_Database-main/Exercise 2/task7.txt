Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTER) JOIN and RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN.

Inner Join includes only rows which have matching values in both tables to the result set.

LEFT Join includes all rows from the left table into the result, but only those rows from the right table which have matching values in the left table.

Right Join includes all rows from the right table into the result, but only those rows from the left table which have matching values in the right table.
