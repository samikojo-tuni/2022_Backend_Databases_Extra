/*
Create a transaction which transfers 500€ from Checking account to Savings account. 
After this create another transaction which transfers 2000€ from Checking account to Saving account.
Why is it important to execute these commands as transactions? Why declaring statements as a
transaction is not usually enough to properly implement this feature?

Note! MariaDB supports variables. You can define the transfered amount as a variable e.g. like
this: SET @amount = 500.00;
